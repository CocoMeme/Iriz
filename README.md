# 👁️ Iriz - Automatic Signboard Reader for the Visually Impaired

Assistive system that captures images of signboards, extracts text with OCR, and converts the text to audio, delivering accessible navigation help for visually impaired users.

> *Iriz - See the world through sound*

## 📖 About

**Iriz** is a comprehensive accessibility solution consisting of a mobile app for visually impaired users, a backend API for data management, and a web dashboard for administrators. The system enables users to capture signboard images, extract text via OCR, and hear the content through text-to-speech technology—all working offline-first with smart synchronization.

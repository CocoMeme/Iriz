---

## Technical Environment

### Detected Configuration

- **Python Version:** 3.11.9
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Shell:** PowerShell
- **Existing Packages:** 100+ packages already available (Flask, pymongo, Pillow, etc.)

### Ready for Installation

- **Backend:** Python virtual environment + 11 packages via pip
- **Mobile:** Expo + 18 React Native packages via npm
- **Web Admin:** Vite + 14 React packages via npm

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Mobile Framework:** Expo + React Native (chosen over Kivy for better OAuth integration)
2. **Authentication:** Google OAuth via Expo Auth Session with JWT backend tokens
3. **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted, free tier available)
4. **Web Framework:** React + Vite (fast development, modern tooling)
5. **Charts:** Recharts primary, Chart.js as alternative
6. **UI Library:** Material UI for consistent admin dashboard design

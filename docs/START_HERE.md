## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Restart Your Expo Server

**In your terminal where Expo is running:**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
npm start

# OR with cache clear (recommended):
npm start -- --clear
```

### 2. Reload Your App in Expo Go

**Option A: Shake your phone**
- Shake device
- Tap "Reload"

**Option B: Scan QR again**
- Scan the new QR code from terminal
- App will reload fresh

### 3. Test OCR Feature

**Step-by-step:**
1. Open app (splash screen → home)
2. Tap "Capture Signboard" button
3. Point camera at ANY TEXT:
   - Book page ✅
   - Printed sign ✅
   - Computer screen ✅
   - Document ✅
4. Tap white capture button
5. Wait 2-5 seconds
6. **SUCCESS:** Text appears with confidence score! 🎉

## 📱 What to Expect

### ✅ Working Correctly:
```
1. Camera opens → ✓
2. Capture photo → ✓
3. "Extracting text..." shows → ✓
4. Processing 2-5 seconds → ✓
5. Text displays → ✓
6. Confidence bar shows → ✓

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before (Broken):
- Used Tesseract.js
- Required Web Workers (not in React Native)
- Failed with "Worker doesn't exist" error

### After (Working):
- Uses OCR.space cloud API
- Standard HTTP requests
- Works perfectly in Expo Go
- No errors!

## 📋 Quick Verification

Test these to confirm everything works:

**Must Work:**
- [ ] No "Worker" error on startup
- [ ] Camera opens successfully
- [ ] Photo captures without crash
- [ ] "Extracting text..." displays
- [ ] Text extracts in 2-5 seconds
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] Text-to-speech plays
- [ ] Confidence score shows

**If ANY fail, see Troubleshooting below**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Internet Required
- Cloud OCR needs internet connection
- Works on WiFi or cellular data
- If offline: Clear error message shown

### First Test
- May take 3-5 seconds (establishing connection)
- Subsequent tests: 2-3 seconds
- This is normal!

### Free API
- Using free OCR.space API
- 25,000 requests/month
- 500 per day
- Perfect for testing/development

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

#### 1. Hard Restart
```bash
# Close Expo completely (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache:
npm start -- --clear
# Reload app in Expo Go
```

#### 2. Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

#### 3. Check Internet
- Verify WiFi/data is on
- Test: Open browser and visit google.com
- Disable VPN if using one

#### 4. Check Console
```bash
# In Expo terminal, press 'j'
# Opens Chrome debugger
# Check console for detailed errors
```

### Common Issues:

**"Network request failed"**
→ No internet. Turn on WiFi/data.

**Processing takes forever**
→ Slow network. Try WiFi instead of cellular.

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ Too many requests. Wait 1 hour or get your own API key.
